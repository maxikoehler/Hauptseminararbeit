\chapter{Summary and outlook}
\label{chap:summary}

Short summary of the results. \mycomment[MK]{Write summary and outlook}

A brief look in the future and why this topic is in the interest, maybe for slightly other applications as well (see \autocite{gaoTransientStabilityAnalysis2024}).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Usage of CCT assessment for different topics like: Grid coupling (stations); transient balancing processes (RoCoF?)
        \item Using of TDS assessment for TSA: controlling of regenerative energy sources like wind turbines; controlling of stability devices like phasor-shifting, grid-forming power electronics
        \item Support of reactive and real power flow controlling: Slower expansion of transient disturbances through grids for stabilization with (comparably slow) primary control
    \end{itemize}
